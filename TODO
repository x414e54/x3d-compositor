Fix TODOs in code!

Transparency.
Normal Mapping.
Displacement Mapping.
Shadows.
Remove requirement for system libraries and decrease any dependencies.

Link physics with x3d correctly.
Cache objects - if nothing in the scene has changed do not update vbos, etc.
Proper batching of indirect draws.
Remove all buffer mapping and make persistent.
Swap over to SSBO when intel/mesa drivers support it.
Swap over to bindless textures when intel/mesa supports it.
Add in extra passes for post processing.
Create a better default scene.

Remove as much QT as possible and use gl_loadergen instead of QOpenGLExtensions.

Add in obj and binary vertex data support to CyberX3D.
Add in CommonSurfaceShader material support to CyberX3D.
Finish sphere implemenation in CyberX3D (segments and recusion, also add option of uv sphere).
Finish adding all direct vertex buffer implemntations for all nodes in CyberX3D.

Create proper threaded loading system so not everything is loaded at the same time.
Setup anchors to work correctly and if anchor is to an html file load a browser or if it is an x3d file create a portal to it in the current X3D scene.
